# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A personal portfolio site for Eshani Somwanshi (product/UX designer), built as a single-page React app (`frontend/`) with a small FastAPI backend (`backend/`) for a contact form. Originally scaffolded by emergent.sh (see `.emergent/`).

## Commands

All frontend commands run from `frontend/`; backend commands from `backend/`.

```bash
# Frontend (CRA via craco)
cd frontend
npm start          # dev server, http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build -> frontend/build
npm test           # craco test (Jest/RTL), interactive watch mode

# Backend (FastAPI)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --reload   # dev server (needs .env — see below)
pytest                        # runs with -n 2 --dist loadscope (fixed in pytest.ini — don't change addopts)
pytest path/to/test.py::TestClass::test_name   # single test
pytest -n 0 path/to/test.py                    # run serially instead of parallel
```

There are currently no test files under `tests/` (just `__init__.py`) and no test files under `frontend/src`.

### Backend environment

`backend/server.py` loads `backend/.env` (gitignored) and requires:
- `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME` — MongoDB connection (via Motor)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — comma-separated allowed origins (defaults to `*`)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional) — if set, `/api/messages` also emails the submission via Resend; `SENDER_EMAIL` / `CONTACT_INBOX` override the from/to addresses.

Frontend reads `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to know where the API lives (`frontend/src/App.js` → `API_BASE`); all API calls are prefixed with `/api`.

## Architecture

### Frontend structure

- **`src/index.js`** — entry point. Sets up `react-router-dom` with two routes: `/` → `App` (the single-page portfolio) and `/work/:slug` → `CaseStudyPage` (full case study reader). Wraps everything in `ReadModeProvider` (`components/site/ReadMode`) and a `QueryClientProvider`.
- **`src/App.js`** — the entire one-page portfolio (header, hero, proof strip, project sections, chaptered case study, capabilities, experience accordion, about, resume, contact form) lives in this one file, ~1000 lines. Content data (proof stats, capabilities, experience, tools, testimonial, nav items) is defined as arrays/objects at the top of the file — **edit content there, not by hunting for it elsewhere**. Several `TODO(Eshani)` comments mark placeholder content (testimonial quote, work-authorization line) that needs a real value before shipping.
- **`src/primitives.js`** — shared animation/UI primitives used throughout `App.js` and `CaseStudyPage.js`: `Reveal` (scroll-triggered fade/rise), `SplitText` (word-by-word headline reveal), `Wipe` (clip-path image reveal), `CountUp`, `Magnetic` (cursor-follow hover), `ThemeSwitch`/`useTheme`, and the `IMG()` helper that resolves `public/images/<name>`. `THEMES` here is the source of truth for the three color themes (paper/carbon/petrol) — theme id is written to `document.documentElement.dataset.theme` and persisted to `localStorage`.
- **`src/caseStudies.js`** — data-only array of case study objects (chapters, metrics, tags, images) consumed by `CaseStudyPage.js`. Adding a new case study means adding an entry here plus a matching link/slug in `App.js`.
- **`src/CaseStudyPage.js`** — renders one case study from `caseStudies.js` by `:slug` route param.
- **`components/devices/`** — device-frame presentational components (`MacBookScroll`, `PhoneFrame`, `RotateCard`, `Assemble`, `ContactDevice`, `DeviceShowcase`) used to mock up screenshots inside project cards.
- **`components/site/`** — page-level chrome: `Preloader` (boot animation), `ReadMode` (a reading-mode context/provider used by case study pages), `BeforeAfter` (before/after image comparison slider).
- **`components/ui/`** — shadcn/ui-style primitives (Radix UI wrappers: dialog, dropdown, tabs, etc.), generated via `components.json` (`shadcn` config: style `new-york`, base color `neutral`, no RSC/TSX). Path alias `@/components/ui/...`.
- **`constants/testIds/`** — central registry of `data-testid` values, re-exported from `constants/testIds/index.js`. These IDs are consumed by an external QA/testing agent to drive automated UI tests — **when adding interactive UI, add a `data-testid`** following the existing per-feature file pattern (`auth.js`, `home.js`, …), and re-export new files from `index.js`.
- **`lib/utils.js`** — `cn()` class-merge helper (clsx + tailwind-merge), standard shadcn convention.
- Path alias `@/*` → `src/*` is configured in both `jsconfig.json` and webpack (`craco.config.js`), and mirrored in `components.json` aliases.

### Styling

Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`) + hand-written CSS alongside components (`App.css`, `index.css`, `devices.css`, `beforeafter.css`, `preloader.css`, `readmode.css`). `design_guidelines.json` at the repo root documents the design system: typography scale (Outfit/Manrope/JetBrains Mono), the three color themes (paper/carbon/petrol) with hex values, and visual enhancers (noise overlay, scroll progress hairline, etc.) — consult it before changing global visual style rather than reverse-engineering values from CSS.

### Build tooling

CRA is wrapped with **craco** (`craco.config.js`) rather than plain `react-scripts`, to add the `@` alias, tune webpack watch options, and optionally wire in an `@emergentbase/visual-edits` dev-mode plugin and a health-check webpack plugin (both gated by env vars — `ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`). No need to touch `craco.config.js` for typical feature work.

### Backend

`backend/server.py` is a single-file FastAPI app: all routes are on an `/api`-prefixed `APIRouter` mounted onto `app`. Two route groups: a legacy `StatusCheck` CRUD pair (`/api/status`) and the contact form endpoint (`POST /api/messages`), which writes to MongoDB (`db.messages`) and optionally sends an email notification via Resend. There's no ORM/model layer beyond Pydantic request/response models defined inline in this file.

### Deploy workflow (git → Vercel)

The GitHub repo has two relevant branches: `main` (preview) and `production` (wired to Vercel's live deploy). Default flow for any change:

1. Commit and push to `main`. This is what an unqualified "push" means — it deploys a Vercel preview, not the live site.
2. Only after the user reviews and explicitly says to go live ("push to production", "ship it", etc.), fast-forward `production` to `main`: `git push origin main:production`. `production` should always be a strict ancestor of `main` (no divergent commits of its own) — if unsure, check first with `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/production...origin/main`.

Never push to `production` on a bare "push" — wait for the explicit go-ahead.

### Testing protocol (`test_result.md`)

The repo root has a `test_result.md` file with a structured YAML-in-Markdown protocol for coordinating between a "main" agent and a "testing" agent (used by the emergent.sh workflow this project was scaffolded from). If asked to record or update test status, follow the format already documented inside that file rather than inventing a new one.
